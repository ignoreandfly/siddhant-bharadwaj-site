    <h1 style="text-align: center;"> How is HTML5 different from HTML? </h1>
    <div style="display: inline; margin: auto; text-align: justify;">
  <p>  Back in 9th grade, my first introduction to programming was HTML. We would use notepad to code, it was only four years later when I started learning web development that I discovered there is something known as HTML 5 as well, I am sure some of you come from the same background as I do and have the same question about what in the name of God is HTML 5 and how is it different from HTML that we learnt in school, let’s find out. </p>

<h2> SO WHAT IS HTML 5?</h2>

<p> HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser and HTML 5 is basically the fifth version of the OG(Original) Html.</h2>

<h2>HOW IS HTML 5 DIFFERENT FROM HTML?</h2>

<p>Well just like updated versions of anything, many features have been removed and added in HTML to make HTML 5. For example, HTML doesn’t support video and audio without the use of Flash Player support whereas HTML 5 doesn’t have that problem. Another thing that HTML 5 and HTML differ in is in terms of mobile support, HTML isn’t mobile-friendly whereas HTML 5. While there are many such differences between the two the one that really stands out and is the reason why everyone uses HTML 5 instead of HTML is that HTML 5 allows Javascript to run in a browser which makes it possible for web developers like you and me to make these amazing website and ultimately resulting in a better experience for the users of the internet </p>
