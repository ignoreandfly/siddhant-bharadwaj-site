   Hi! I am Siddhant, I have just started learning programing and I am super excited about it.  

   I have worked on few CLI apps, I will showcase it here tomorrow. 

   My favourite book is Man Search's For Meaning by Viktor Frankl, it has two parts. First being about Viktor Frankl's experience in concentration 
   camp and second being aboout logotheraphy developed by Viktor Frankl.
